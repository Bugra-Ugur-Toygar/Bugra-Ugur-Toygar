Hello, my name is Buğra Uğur Toygar.
I’m interested in working projects which is written with JavaScript and React, in future of my career I want to learn back-end languages as well to work in robotic field. Also, in my personal life I'm going to gym regularly to keep mental and physical health up.
I cannot say that I am professional at HTML CSS and JS because I have started to learn those since September, 2023, yet I'm keeping up to learning process by taking lessons and making projects to master. Currently I have focus on learning React.js.
I’m looking to collaborate on companies that works at Front-End area to improve my skills and enjoy with the team.
